### Public Poll
This mobile website was developed in 2 weeks for the final project of the Le Wagon bootcamp. It allows users to create polls on any topic, which are shared with a community to get the general public's opinion. Users can see polls by categories, they can save them, and they can even check each other's profiles and add friends.

The nexts steps will be to improve responsiveness and to add a new messaging feature.
